# Polybius-Cipher

The Polybius Square Cipher substitutes each letter of the plaintext with a pair of coordinates from a grid, adding complexity to simple substitution ciphers. It is named after the Greek historian Polybius.

A **Polybius Square** is a table that allows someone to convert letters into numbers. To make the encryption little harder, this table can be randomized and shared with the recipient. In order to fit the 26 letters of the alphabet into the 25 cells created by the table, the letters ‘i’ and ‘j’ are usually combined into a single cell. Originally there was no such problem because the ancient greek alphabet has 24 letters.
